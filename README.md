## Description:
The 'Get Phished!' project aims to educate and empower users to recognize and protect themselves against phishing attacks, which are deceptive attempts to steal sensitive information. The project encompasses a comprehensive strategy involving educational resources, a simulated phishing exercise, and a post-incident report.

## What is a Phishing Campaign?
A phishing campaign is a coordinated and malicious effort by cybercriminals to deceive individuals or groups into disclosing sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal details. This is typically achieved by sending deceptive emails, messages, or links that appear legitimate but actually direct recipients to fake websites or malicious software. The goal of a phishing campaign is to exploit human trust and curiosity to gain unauthorized access to valuable information or compromise computer systems.

## What does this Phishing Campaign do?
This project overviews the importance of user education, simulates an email phishing campaign conducted by a pentesting company, and showcases the post-incident report of said campaign.
